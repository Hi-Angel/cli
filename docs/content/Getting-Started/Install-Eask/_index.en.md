This document guides you through the installation of Eask.

Install Eask on macOS, Linux, Windows, BSD, and on any machine that can run the [Node.js][].

{{< toc >}}

## 💾 Prebuilt binaries

Download the appropriate version for your platform from [Eask Releases](https://github.com/emacs-eask/cli/releases).
Once downloaded, the binary can be run from anywhere. You don’t need to install
it in a global location. This works well for shared hosts and other systems
where you don’t have a privileged account.

Ideally, you should install it somewhere in your `PATH` for easy use. `/usr/local/bin`
is the most probable location.

## 💾 Using Shell

On macOS or Linux:

```sh
$ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emacs-eask/cli/master/webinstall/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows:

```sh
$ curl.exe -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emacs-eask/cli/master/webinstall/install.bat | cmd /Q
```
